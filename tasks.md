# Tasks

Owned by the spec chat. The build chat only changes a task's status mark and its `Result:` / `Question:` lines
(workflow: CLAUDE.md). Do tasks top-down within **Now**. **Later** items are outlines: the spec chat details them
(files, steps, accept) and moves them to Now. Next free id: **T-090** (T-088 is open below).

Status: `[ ]` todo · `[~]` in progress · `[?]` blocked — see Question · `[x]` done

## Task template
```
### [ ] T-000: <imperative title>
Spec: §x.y          Goldens: unchanged | update (<why>)          Save: no change | RUN_VERSION bump (<why>)
Goal: <one or two sentences: the observable outcome>
Files: <exact paths the build chat may edit; new files marked (new) — also add to index.html>
Do not: <things that look tempting but are wrong for this task>
Steps:
1. <concrete step naming functions/constants/globals>
Accept:
- <checkable criterion: test, headless sim number, or visible behaviour>
QA: none | Monster game | career run → <screen and action>
Result:
```

## State (2026-10-02)
Everything through T-089 and cleanup part 2 (T-082…T-087) is built (103 tests, RUN_VERSION 15).
Built areas: match engine (ego, block collision, subs/coach, stamina, elements, hype, 3D playback, Follow/POV cameras),
career (free agent start at 1, pools/evaluations/U21 cup, Story mode, growth & techniques, challenges & injuries,
rankings, roads/travel/town/venues, living map A, relationships T-060…T-066), voice pass, cleanup part 1.

## Now
(empty — pick from Later; the owner decides the next feature)

## Later — outlines
Features (spec first):
- Faction events that change the map (spec §4.24, draft — owner to confirm).
- Endless mode (spec §4.26: no guarantees; national call-up by grades).
- Living map layers B / C (spec §4.16: individual figures, approaches on the map).
- Balance pass (spec §4.10 condition values, §5.5 severe injury, hype frequency §2.3).

Cleanup, part 2: T-082…T-087 done (see Done). Open:
- T-088 [?]: Big binaries — keep base64 for the artifact but store .glb/.mp3 in Git LFS and generate the .txt at publish.
  Question: today `assets/vrm/*.glb.txt` (18 MB of base64 text) and the .mp3 sit in plain git. Moving them to LFS means either
  `git lfs migrate import` (rewrites history, needs a force push) or LFS only for new commits (old blobs stay). Which? Also confirm
  LFS is enabled for glairlyyy/spiker and that the artifact publish step may decode/encode (`base64 -d` / `base64`) at publish time.

## Unplanned changes
(build chat: owner requests made directly in the build chat — one line each; the spec chat moves them into spec.md)
