# Tasks

Owned by the spec chat. The build chat only changes a task's status mark and its `Result:` / `Question:` lines
(workflow: CLAUDE.md). Do tasks top-down within **Now**. **Later** items are outlines: the spec chat details them
(files, steps, accept) and moves them to Now. Next free id: **T-159** (T-088 is open below).

Status: `[ ]` todo · `[~]` in progress · `[?]` blocked — see Question · `[x]` done

## Task template

```
### [ ] T-000: <imperative title>
Spec: §x.y          Goldens: unchanged | update (<why>)          Save: no change | RUN_VERSION bump (<why>)
Goal: <one or two sentences: the observable outcome>
Files: <exact paths the build chat may edit; new files marked (new) — also add to index.html>
Do not: <things that look tempting but are wrong for this task>
Steps:
1. <concrete step naming functions/constants/globals>
Accept:
- <checkable criterion: test, headless sim number, or visible behaviour>
QA: none | Monster game | career run → <screen and action>
Result:
```

## State (2026-10-03)

Everything through T-158 is built (110 tests, RUN_VERSION 17): match engine and 3D playback, career (28 weeks, pools,
evaluations, U21 Cup, Story mode, growth, relationships), UI redesign §9–§10, hex territory and economy §4.27, island
× 1.5, cleanup parts 1–3. Done tasks are one-liners under **Done**; full text in git history.

## Now

(empty — the spec chat details the next tasks from **Later**.)

## Later — outlines

UI polish (spec §9, design system fix-plan Batch 7) — spec chat details when Now/Next are done:

- Faction recolour (§5.6 — owner approval first).
- Main menu: Continue as the hero card when a save exists; Playtest card + Debug-log badge behind `?dev`.
- Create: replace the all-1 stat bars with a role explainer; hide the Mode control until Endless exists.
- Podium and box score: spelled-out stat names. Encyclopedia: section tabs show the current section.

Features (spec first):

- Faction events that change the map (spec §4.24, draft — owner to confirm).
- Endless mode (spec §4.26: no guarantees; national call-up by grades).
- Living map layers B / C (spec §4.16: individual figures, approaches on the map).
- Balance pass (spec §4.10 condition values, §5.5 severe injury, hype frequency §2.3).

Cleanup, part 2: T-082…T-087 done (see Done). Open:

- T-088 [?]: Big binaries — keep base64 for the artifact but store .glb/.mp3 in Git LFS and generate the .txt at publish.
  Question: today `assets/vrm/*.glb.txt` (18 MB of base64 text) and the .mp3 sit in plain git. Moving them to LFS means either
  `git lfs migrate import` (rewrites history, needs a force push) or LFS only for new commits (old blobs stay). Which? Also confirm
  LFS is enabled for glairlyyy/spiker and that the artifact publish step may decode/encode (`base64 -d` / `base64`) at publish time.
