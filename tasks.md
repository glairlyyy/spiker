# Tasks

Owned by the spec chat. The build chat only changes a task's status mark and its `Result:` / `Question:` lines
(workflow: CLAUDE.md). Do tasks top-down within **Now**. Never start **Later** tasks: they are outlines, and the spec
chat details them (files, steps, accept) and moves them to Now when their phase starts.

Status: `[ ]` todo · `[~]` in progress · `[?]` blocked — see Question · `[x]` done

## Roadmap
- Phase 1 — Island rules ✓ · 1b — Match feel ✓ · 1c — Cut-scene lines ✓ · 2 — Faction pools (T-006/T-007 ✓, T-008 left)
- Cleanup + info ✓ (T-016 Legacy removed, T-017/T-018 faction dossier)
- **Phase 3 — Evaluations**: Academy squad (leave action); calendar → monthly evaluations; faction evaluations.
- **Phase 4 — U21 Final Cup**: 16-slot bracket; cup from drawn squads; retire the Skyline/Grand cups and the 8
  fixed teams.
- **Phase 5 — Voice pass**: faction/region/Gazette strings rewritten in lore.md §7 voices.

## Now
(empty — the spec chat details the next phase here)

## Later — outlines (not ready: the spec chat details each before it moves to Now)

Phase 2 (rest)
- T-008: League transfers move players between pools (reserves ↔ teams); reserves grow like team players.

Phase 3 — Evaluations
- T-009: Academy squad: rename pickup → Academy squad in UI/log; "Leave squad" action (inline confirm); alone
  state (no mates: training partners, outings and bonds handle an empty squad).
- T-010: Calendar: evaluation weeks 4–24 replace warm-ups; camp 26–28; eligibility by status (§4.11).
- T-011: Evaluation matches: Academy (vs a drawn major squad) and major-faction (drawn squads of your pool;
  not drawn → you watch). Rewards = warm-up rewards.

Phase 4 — U21 Final Cup
- T-012: 16-slot bracket with byes in js/game/bracket.js (8-team brackets keep working until T-013).
- T-013: U21 Final Cup from drawn squads + Academy squad; replaces both cups; Legacy keeps working
  (DOUBLE_CROWN becomes unreachable — leave it, spec §5.3 open).
- T-014: Retire the 8 fixed teams: `FACTIONS` becomes per region; HQ pins per faction; scouting per faction.

Phase 5 — Voice pass
- T-015: Faction `front`/`dark`, region `desc`, Gazette and event strings in lore.md §7 voices.

## Done
(one line each; full task text is in git history)
- [x] T-016: Remove Legacy (unlocks, points, pure runs, Hall of Fame, legends) for good — legacy.js deleted, career-legacy.js → career-end.js; Run.create always free agent; 21/21 + lint; grep clean (renamed chart-legend class to chartkey); goldens/engine untouched; QA: menu/create/run-end via Sim ⏭ (rank C + chart), no pageerror. Note: CLAUDE.md line 62 still lists “legacy” among ui screens
- [x] T-017: `Dossier.build(run, r)` — DOM-free faction dossier model — Dossier.build in js/career/dossier.js; new test (state, places incl. seized, roster gate, minor); 22/22 + lint; goldens untouched; headless only. Unscouted place quality = the region's advertised q (no qMul)
- [x] T-018: Faction dossier window — ui/career-dossier.js, HQ Dossier button, Factions-drawer name links, modal in hub, Esc closes; 22/22 + lint; QA: Wei dossier — 7 facilities = map, roster “unknown” until scouted then ratings; Shu opened from the Factions drawer; row click → map spot; no pageerror (screenshots taken, not committed)
- [x] T-001: Rename Sacred Shrine Park → Central Academy — names/comments only; 21/21 + lint; career-run visual QA not run.
- [x] T-002: Facility access gate (grudge + owner condition) — ACCESS in world.js, City.access + gate in City.can; new test; 21/21 + lint; console QA not run.
- [x] T-003: Ball shadow circle on the floor — marker follows the ball exactly, hidden with it; widens + fades with height. Owner change in build chat: white outlined ring, no fill.
- [x] T-004: Spike approach — run-up point, take-off before the ball — QA 42 non-quick attacks: take-off 0.6–1.2 m in 90.5 %, end-of-set distance max 0.054 m, 0 over-sprint moves. Added: `direct` (too far to run up → straight to take-off), `via` back attack 2nd leg ends at take-off. Fix: jump serves excluded from approachOf.
- [x] T-005: 2–3 more line variants for every cut-scene kind — e282653 — 20 kinds × 5 personalities, 5–6 lines each (min 5, max 6), 245 added, all ≤ 40 chars; golden diff = `matches` only; 21/21 + lint; Max Hype scenes show new lines, no pageerror (bubble fit not visually confirmed).
- [x] T-006: Faction reserves — every faction becomes a roster (pool) of players — pools Wei 20 / Wu 14 / Shu 10 / Outlaws 6 / Gloria 5 (reserves 12/6/2/2/1 after league players); RUN_VERSION 2; Hard also boosts reserves; 22/22 + lint; goldens and js/engine untouched; QA: new run loads, map/HQ fine, no pageerror
- [x] T-007: `Pool.draw` — weighted squad draw from a faction pool — DRAW in world.js, Pool.draw in pool.js (you placed first in your role slot at standing ≥ 60; a free agent is never a candidate; role shortage → best remaining); new test; 23/23 + lint; goldens and js/engine untouched; headless only

## Unplanned changes
(build chat: owner requests made directly in the build chat — one line each; the spec chat moves them into spec.md)
